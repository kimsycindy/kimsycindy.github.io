            <p>
              I am a recent Drama graduate of Queen Mary University of London
              with experience in playwriting and working at a London-based VR
              theatre startup, looking for avenues to develop experience with
              immersive storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about stories that facilitate intersectional social
              change, particularly about AI, VR, and other emerging
              technologies. Recently, Iâ€™ve written and directed a play about the
              intersection of automation and criminal processes in crisis that
              was performed at the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
            </p>
            <p>
              With earnest urgency in mind, I create work with a thoughtful,
              conscientious approach to the implications of rapidly developing
              technology, and exploring the fascinating - and unexpected! - ways
              it permeates and cross-pollinates every aspect of our lives.
